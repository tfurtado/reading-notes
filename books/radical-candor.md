## Introduction

* Rock stars: people who are very good at their job and are happy where they are
* Superstars: the people who strive for growth and promotion
* A boss' hability to achieve results has more to do with listening than telling people what to do
* Ripple effect: The relatiosnhips you have with your reports will affect their relationships with theirs

## 1. Build radically candid relationships

* Emotional labor is part of a manager's jog. "It's not babysitting, it's your *job*"
* "Bosses guide a team to achieve results"
* A boss' responsibilities:
  * **Guidance** is all about feedback
  * **Team-building** is about having the right people in the team and keeping them motivated to stay
  * **Results**
* Good, deep, personal relationships are the basis of a successful team.
* **Radical Candor**: building trus and open the channels for direct communication along two dimensions:
  * **Care Personally**: relationships at work must not be only professional. It must be a whole, human connection.
    * Part of a boss' job is to create more joy instead of misery
    * "Being a boss is a *job*, not a value judgement"
    * Caring *personally* is about caring for the whole self of others, not only the work they do or their careers.
  * **Challenge Directly**: challenging people when they don't meet expectations and delivering hard feedback to paint the true picture.
    * Challenging *directly* means that at some point, people in your team will be mad at you. If they are *never* mad, you're not challenging them enough.
    * Take the phrase "don't take it personally" off your vocabulary. Offer to help fix the problem instead.
    * The hardest part is inviting people to challenge *you* directly.
    * Challenging people takes energy from both. Save it for what's worth it.
* Both dimenstions are measuread at the listener's ear, not the speaker's mouth.
