## Introduction

* Rock stars: people who are very good at their job and are happy where they are
* Superstars: the people who strive for growth and promotion
* A boss' hability to achieve results has more to do with listening than telling people what to do
* Ripple effect: The relatiosnhips you have with your reports will affect their relationships with theirs

## 1. Build radically candid relationships

* Emotional labor is part of a manager's jog. "It's not babysitting, it's your *job*"
* "Bosses guide a team to achieve results"
* A boss' responsibilities:
  * **Guidance** is all about feedback
  * **Team-building** is about having the right people in the team and keeping them motivated to stay
  * **Results**
* Good, deep, personal relationships are the basis of a successful team.
* **Radical Candor**: building trus and open the channels for direct communication along two dimensions:
  * **Care Personally**: relationships at work must not be only professional. It must be a whole, human connection.
    * Part of a boss' job is to create more joy instead of misery
    * "Being a boss is a *job*, not a value judgement"
    * Caring *personally* is about caring for the whole self of others, not only the work they do or their careers.
  * **Challenge Directly**: challenging people when they don't meet expectations and delivering hard feedback to paint the true picture.
    * Challenging *directly* means that at some point, people in your team will be mad at you. If they are *never* mad, you're not challenging them enough.
    * Take the phrase "don't take it personally" off your vocabulary. Offer to help fix the problem instead.
    * The hardest part is inviting people to challenge *you* directly.
    * Challenging people takes energy from both. Save it for what's worth it.
* Both dimenstions are measuread at the listener's ear, not the speaker's mouth.

## 2. Get, give and encourage guidance

* The _Radical Candor_ framework is a powerful tool to assess **guidance** we get or give people.
* Guidance should **never** be about the person but the event or behaviour at hand.
* The framework is **not a _personality test_**.
* Understanding _Radical Candor_ is important but also it's imperative to know what happens when one _fails_ in one of the dimensions when providing guidance.
  * Radical Candor
    * "It's not mean, it's clear!"
    * Radically Candid praise:
      * Be mindful of how praises land at the people
      * Be specific, not general ("I admire _that_ about you")
    * Radically Candid criticism: "To keep winning, criticise the wins"
  * Obnoxious Aggression
    * Being direct, even when not caring personally, is an effective way of achieving results
    * "Most people prefer the challenging 'jerk' to the boss whose 'nicesness' gets in the way of candor"
    * Depsite the short-term good results, it's debilitating in the long run
    * Criticism: is like front-stabbing someone; better than backstabing but still very awful.
    * Praise: is still specific but it makes clear whoever is praising does not care about the people. This kind of praise can make people feel _worse_ instead of better after the praise ("Well, you got it right _this_ time")
  * Manipulative Insincerity
    * When you don't care enough about the person to challenge them directly
    * "When you're overly worried about how people will perceive you, you're less willing to say what needs to be said."
    * Praise: "the false apology".
      * Manipulative Insincerity happens if people move in the _Challenge Directly_ dimension instead of _Care Personally_.
      * It's better to say nothing than faking a praise to avoid things getting worse for **yourself**.
  * Ruinous Empathy
    * Caring without challenging directly may ruin an employee's or team's chance of success, even if the intention iss the opposite.
    * When bosses are too invested in everyone getting along together, the team prioritises being nice instead of improving performance through good critiquing
    * It's not possible to build trus in a relationship based on Ruinous Empathy. Either side of it will not feel confident to request criticism until the inevitable happens: someone quits.
    * Praise: "just trying to say something nice"
      * Be as specific with praise as with criticism: investigate until you really understand who did what and why it was so great
* To start moving towards practicing _Radical Candor_, start by requesting radically candid feedback.
* Start with giving praise, then criticism.
* Asking for criticism
  * **Activelly** ask for criticism
  * Don't critique their criticism; be prepared to not get defensive; fight for the initial "sting"
  * If a direct report makes innappropriate critiscim towards their colleagues, say something about it. If it's about **you**, take it and reward their candor.
  * Whatever criticism you receive, act on it. Show that you care.
* Balance praise and criticism
  * We should give more praise than criticism
  * There must be some investment to provide good criticism
    * "How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you criticise somebody?"
    * "How long do you spend making sure you have all the facts right before you _praise_ somebody?"
* The dangerous border between _Radical Candor_ and _Obnoxious Aggression_
  * Every criticism must be provided such that it **clearly** states what is wrong and **why**
  * Good criticism gives people a way of getting to the path towards successs
  * "People who are concerned with getting to the right answers than with being right make the best bosses."
