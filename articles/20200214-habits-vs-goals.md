There's a fundamental difference between habits and goals: they require different forms of action. For example: "We want to learn a new language. We could decide we want to be fluent in six months (goal), or we could commit to 30 minutes of practice each day (habit)."

## The problems with goals

* They have an **endpoint**. After achieving it, some people tend to go back to the previous behaviour or state.
* Goals rely on things **we can't control**. Some externalities can ruin our capacity to achieve a goal. For example, if you get injured while pursuing the goal to run a marathon in 6 months.
* We need to **intentionally put effort** to achieve goals. According to Charles Duhigg (The Power of Habit), "Willpower [...] gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things".
* Goals can foster **unethical behaviour**. People can become reckless for the sake of achieving their goals.

## The benefits of habits

* Habits could help us **exceed our goals**. By putting small habits in place, we can break down big goals and we could end up achieving something that seems scary in the beginning. For example, the goal is to write a novel. I set myself to write 200 words a day so that I finish it in 250 days. In some inspired days, I could end up writing 1000 words and I'll finish the novel in less time than anticipated. But if the goal was "write a novel in 4 months", it could be overwhelming.
* They are **easy to complete**. After we develop a, our brains can change to make the new behaviour easier to complete. Duhigg says "Habits [...] are so strong that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else [...]".
* Habits are **for life**. Duhigg's research shows that habits make up to 40% of our waking hours. Summed up, they make us who we are. Once a habit "sticks" with us, it can last for life (if not broken for any reason).
* They can be as **small** as necessary and **compound**. It's easier to start with small habits and increase their complexity with time. For example, flossing one tooth, then building on top of it until flossing all teeth becomes a habit. Some habits can also lead to compound effects because habits can spread to other parts of our lives. Those so-called **keystone habits** have a wider in our lives. For example, people who start exercising could end up eating better and sleeping better.

## Why a systemic approach works

Building long-lasting habits can help us improve our lives continuously instead of achieving specific goals. There are examples of many successful people to support that idea, from investors to writers to athletes. Goals rely on **extrinsic motivation**. Habits are automatic and we don't need willpower or self-control to benefit from them. Thus, investing in building positive habits is a better investment of time and energy than focusing on goals to achieve something in our lives.

## Summary

* Goals can motivate but need constant willpower for one to benefit from them in the long-term.
* Habits are automatic and can rewire our brains.
* The effects of ingrained habits can compound by leading to new habits in other areas of our lives.
